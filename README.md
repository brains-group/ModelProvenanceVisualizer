# ModelProvenanceVisualizer

I am working on a Python based provenance visualizer to allow users to track dataset and model usage. Users can add datasets and their relevant metadata and can simulate creating models on such datasets. Relationships between models and datasets are logged and can be visualized to see the connections. Queries are being worked on to further provide more useful aggregated information on dataset/models.
